Introduction
------------
"OpenImageIO is a library for reading and writing images, and a bunch of 
 related classes, utilities, and applications."

From OIIO to Ohiio
------------------
OIIO is wonderfully versatile, handles many image formats, and emphasizes
performance. In addition, it is released under the BSD license.

The goal of this project is to access the power and speed of OIIO from Haskell.


Installation (OSX)
------------------
In Xcode, create a new project, selecting:
        "Mac OSX" -> "Framework & Library" -> "C/C++ Library".

Add ohiio.h and ohiio.cpp from this repository.

After properly building OIIO on your system, locate libOpenImageIO.dylib 
(probably in your oiio/dist/macosx/lib/ directory) and add it to the 
Xcode target.

Also add all of the OIIO headers (oiio/src/include/) to the Xcode project.

After successfully building this Xcode project, you'll need to locate the 
dynamic library you just created. That is most likely located in:

   yourxcodeproject/DerivedData/ohiio/Build/Products/Debug/libohiio.dylib

Next, take this full path and place it in the file "ohiio.cabal", in the 
"extra-lib-dirs" field (replace the path that's currently there).

Finally, "cabal install" will build and install the Haskell libraries.
Load GHCI into your shell and type "import OhiioBindings". If there is no
error, the installation was successful.
